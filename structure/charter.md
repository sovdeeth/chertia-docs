# ðŸ“œ Charter

#### **Community Membership**

1. A â€˜community memberâ€™ is defined as a person who is on the server whitelist and has been active in the last 60 days.
2. Anyone who does not fall within the definition of community member may be removed from the server whitelist and kicked from the Discord server.
   1. If a community member has given advance notice that they will not be active for a period longer than 60 days, they may retain their status.
   2. If it comes to light that a community member lied on their whitelist application, they will be permanently banned from the community.

#### **Community Moderation**

1. A â€˜staff memberâ€™ is defined as a moderator or an administrator. A storyteller is not a staff member, but works closely with the staff team.
2. To become a storyteller, a community member must have been active in the community for at least 30 days, and must receive approval from the administrators.
3. To become a moderator, a community member must pass a community vote with at least **50%+1** approval.
4. To become an administrator, a moderator must pass a community vote with at least **66.7% (â…”)** approval.
5. All moderators are subject to a full community review every **6 months**. Internal reviews may be held at any time.
   1. During a review, if the administrators **unanimously** agree that the moderator should be removed, they will be removed immediately. If they cannot agree, the community will decide with a vote.&#x20;
   2. Community members must vote with a majority of **50%+1** in order for the moderator to retain their position.
6. All administrators are subject to a review every **12 months**.
   1. If at least **66.7% (â…”)** of the community agree that the administrator should be removed, they will be removed immediately.
7. All moderators and administrators will have access to the server console and files.
8. Punishment decisions involving temporary or permanent bans must be made by at least two staff members (excluding storytellers), one of which **must** be an administrator. Warnings and mutes should receive advice from an administrator, but it is not required; nonetheless, at least two staff members must make the decision.

#### **Bans & Appeals**

1. In warranted circumstances, a moderator may apply a written, formal warning to a playerâ€™s record. These warnings are to be in effect for a period of **60 days**.
   1. If a community member receives **3** concurrent warnings or punishments on their record, they are to be temporarily banned until a point where one of those warnings has expired. Staff members may decide by vote in this circumstance that the community member should be permanently banned instead.
2. A punishment decision can be appealed within a period of **48 hours** of the original punishment.
   1. Each punishment decision can be appealed only once. Further attempts to appeal or harassment of a staff member may result in a permanent ban.
   2. If appealed, all staff members will hold an internal discussion and vote on if the playerâ€™s punishment decision should stand. This period of discussion and voting will last for **24 hours**, or until all staff members have voted.
   3. Permanent bans will remain on a playerâ€™s record, even if appealed. As a result, one of the open punishment â€˜slotsâ€™ is taken away (i.e. the player would only need two concurrent warnings to be banned).&#x20;
3. A community member, or staff member can be removed from the community without chance of appeal if they pose a threat to other members of the community. These decisions will only be made after lengthy discussion, and are not taken lightly.

#### **Community Rules**

1. New rules may be added at any time with an advanced notice of at least **24 hours**. New rules must be approved by at least **66.7% (â…”)** of the staff team.
2. The community rules may be amended or changed at any time with an advanced notice of at least **24 hours**. Amendments and changes must be unanimously agreed upon by the administrators.&#x20;

#### **State of Emergency**

1. In _extremely extenuating_ circumstances (such as an attack on the community, the sudden departure of a staff member, etc.), the administrators may unanimously agree to enact a state of emergency.
   1. A state of emergency may last for any period of time.
   2. A state of emergency will allow the administrators to make changes to the community, bypassing vote processes.
   3. A state of emergency may end upon the unanimous agreement of the administrators.&#x20;
