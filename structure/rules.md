#### **Infringement Levels**

Our infringement levels system is used to help determine punishments. Punishments received may differ depending on the severity of the offence & the offence history of the individual being punished, so these are to be treated as a simple guide on what to expect. New members will face much higher scrutiny.

All punishments are decided on a case-by-case basis involving at least two staff members, at least one of which must be an administrator. In cases where a punishment must be applied quickly but the extent/length of it has not yet been determined, you will receive a "holding ban", which will see you banned from the server for a period of time while we determine your final punishment. You may appeal your case during this time using our appeals form at the bottom of this page.

| **Rule**   | **Infringement Level** |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| **#1 (1)** | Severe                 |
| **#1 (2)** | Moderate               |
| **#1 (3)** | Moderate               |
| **#2 (1)** | Severe                 |
| **#2 (2)** | Moderate               |
| **#2 (3)** | Moderate               |
| **#2 (4)** | Moderate               |
| **#3 (1)** | Severe                 |
| **#3 (2)** | Mild                   |
| **#3 (3)** | Mild                   |
| **#4 (1)** | Mild                   |
| **#4 (2)** | Moderate               |
| **#4 (3)** | Mild                   |
| **#5 (1)** | Mild                   |
| **#5 (2)** | Moderate               |
| **#5 (2)** | Mild                   |
| **#5 (3)** | Moderate               |
| **#5 (4)** | Mild                   |
| **#5 (5)** | Mild                   |
| **#6**     | Mild to Moderate       |



| **Infringement Level** | **Expected Punishment**    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Mild**               | Warning and/or mute        |
| **Moderate**           | Mute and/or temporary ban  |
| **Severe**             | Temporary or permanent ban |

Offences are wiped from your record after 60 days. Note that **having 3 concurrent offences on your record results in a ban that will last until a time when one of those offences is wiped**, unless one of those punishments is a permanent ban. Additionally, receiving more than 3 temporary bans will result in a permanent ban without appeal.

#### **Acceptable Modifications**

For a list of acceptable modifications, [view our modpack page](https://www.reddit.com/r/theworldofchertia/wiki/modpack), which includes all of them. Other cosmetic mods may be allowed -- consult a staff member first.

#### **Appeals**

If you have received a punishment and do not agree with it, you may appeal using our [**appeals form**](https://forms.gle/tf6AQCrLicfhHr1K9). Please send one of us a message once the form is submitted.

Severe infringement bans cannot be appealed.
