### **📚 The Official Guide to Chertia**

#### **📣 What is Chertia?**

Chertia is a roleplay/survival server full of magic, monsters, and gods. It has been running since 2015. We are currently on Season 5 of a complete canon reset that happened at the start of 2020. Season 5 is a long-term world that began on April 15, 2022, and will run for at least a year. However, we have recently done a small refresh, with the playerbase being moved to a new area on the map -- this is the perfect time to join.

Both of these core aspects -- roleplay and survival -- are at the very centre of how this server operates. They are intertwined. All survival gameplay is done ‘in-character’, and all roleplay is done in-game.&#x20;

#### **🧑‍⚖️ Community Rules**

We are very organized, and have a detailed set of rules and a list of infringement levels. You can view the full list of rules on our [Rules](../structure/rules.md) page. But for the summary…

1. No griefing or stealing.
2. No hacked clients, unapproved mods, or glitch exploits.
3. Be respectful of others.
4. All mob farm designs must be approved by staff. Most automatic farms are not allowed.
5. Be kind & remain appropriate.
6. Follow the survival & roleplay guidelines.
7. The answer to the last question on the whitelist application is "cashmere".

#### **📖 Roleplay**

Each player has a character. In Chertia, you live and breathe your character. Your actions are their actions. As a result, development and relationships are crucial. Your character needs to develop over time, and they need to maintain relationships with other characters. If you don’t do these things, you won’t have as much fun. We try to make it easy, but certain guidelines need to be in place to make sure everyone is on a level playing field. Guidelines such as…

* Your character must be original.
* Your character cannot share a name with you (real name, nickname, etc.).
* Your character cannot have split or multiple personalities.
* Your character must originate from another world. They cannot be native to Chertia.
* Your character cannot be overpowered or ‘perfect’.
* Your character cannot act as an antagonist to the story.

For a full rundown of the rules and guidelines surrounding characters and roleplay, view our [Character Guide](character-guide.md).

#### **⚔️ Survival**

Survival is (mostly) just like vanilla Minecraft. You won’t drop your important gear when you die (but you will drop your other items and experience), and there are added recipes and items to help with immersion. There’s also a fully-fleshed magic system, which is exclusive to Chertia. We’ve put a lot of work into the technical element of our survival gameplay. With survival comes some other guidelines, but these are simpler…

* Do not leave floating trees or one-block towers.
* Automatic farms are not permitted.
* All farm designs must be approved by staff.

Our Survival Guide is still in the works, but these are the general guidelines in place right now.

#### **🧛 Characters**

The process of character creation is done in-game. You can, however, start drafting your character beforehand. Our [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) guide will tell you more about characters, and how you can create and submit yours.

#### **📆 Events**

We have events where story characters and player characters will work together to progress the main storyline. We usually have 1-3 events per week (2 is the norm), typically one every Friday and another 1 or 2 events some other time(s) during the week. Everyone is free to attend these events, but you must have an approved character to participate.&#x20;

#### **🖥 Mods**

We have an optional performance-focused modpack, that also includes several QOL features that we use on a regular basis. It’s based on Quilt, which is a fork of Fabric, and is very lightweight (it actually has better performance than vanilla, for most people). You can download it [here](../other/modpack.md). While it’s not mandatory to use this, using other mods is not allowed (unless they are approved by a staff member).&#x20;

#### **🐷 Farms**

Automatic farms and AFK farms are not allowed. All other farms must be approved by a staff member. We don’t generally turn down farm designs (as long as they’re not automatic or AFK farms). Iron golem farms are also not allowed. You can either send a message to an available moderator or use the report function (/report) to have your farm approved. If it's not approved and you've already built it, you can either modify it to have it fit within the rules, or have the materials returned to you and the area rolled back by a staff member.

#### **❤️ Welcome**

Chertia is a close-knit community, but we are always welcoming new members into the fold. We have an introductions channel in the Discord, and if you join during peak times, someone will usually come greet you if they’re available. See you soon!
