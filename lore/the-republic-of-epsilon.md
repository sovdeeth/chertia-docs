### Description

_Founded very recently, Epsilon is a heavily technology-focused nation. The nation was founded on the principles of progress, knowledge, and development. They typically struggle to use or understand magic._

_The Kingdom is led by Leader Tendaji Madaki._

### Groups

#### Cevilla (Clan)

This **diverse** clan is a coalition of adventuring groups. Considered to be loosely named after the old Goddess of Adventure, the Cevilla clan are expansonists. They believe in discovering new places and making it theirs -- to the point where they can sometimes be viewed as thieves.

_Characters from this region will seek possessions and territory._

#### The Bronze Shield (Location)

This is a **diverse** city in the eastern region of the unmarked territory, currently owned by Theta. The city is divided into warriors and traders. Warriors train to protect the clan, while traders run the economy and perform research. The structure is not concrete, and the clan is very open. They are known, however, for occasionally being reckless.

_Characters from this region will be opinionated and focused on combat or trade._

#### Bluefire (Location/Clan)

Bluefire is a city in the southern region of the unmarked territory, and also the name of the clan that inhabits it. It is primarily comprised of **humans, golems, and elves**, but others are welcome. It is Epsilon's most populous clan, and mainly focuses on technological research. It is the home of Leader Tendaji Madaki.

_Characters from this region will have an affinity for technology._
