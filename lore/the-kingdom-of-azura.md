### Groups

#### Keepers of the Coin (Clan)

An **inclusive** alliance of merchants, largely recognized as the centrepiece of all Divian economy. Founded by a group of caplings, this clan is now open to all. They serve as regulators and advisors for the rest of the world. This has made them develop an obsession with money.

_Characters from this clan will be largely focused on money and status._

#### Circuit Mountain (Location)

This mountain is inhabited by a small community of **dwarves** and **golems** who mine and sell redstone. The community was once just dwarves, but ancient golems were reawakened by the events of the Second Great Magic War, and now serve the dwarves. This is an inclusive community, but it is expected that everyone contributes.

_Characters from this location will focus on the common good and prefer to associate themselves with other dedicated individuals._

#### Altairia (Location)

Inhabited by the Grandt Sky Association, Altairia is a **diverse** city in the sky located in eastern Azura. It is a technology-focused mercantile clan, leading to some conflict with the neighbouring Magus Collective. The Grandt Sky Association is a collection of merchants that have banded together to regulate prices and maximize profits. The merchants work with engineers in researching and creating new technology - and commercializing it to the fullest effect.

_Characters from this location can be varied, but will typically have a technology focus._

#### Daikoten (Location)

This settlement is inhabited by an alliance of caplings and dwarves who primarily focus on jewelry-crafting and bartering. They mine precious minerals when they can, and work closely with the residents of Circuit Mountain. Its inhabits are largely focused on self-image as a result of their production of jewelry and other luxury goods.

_Characters from this location are typically obsessed with self-image._
