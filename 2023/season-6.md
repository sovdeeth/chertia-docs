# üó∫ Season 6

Season 6 is an upcoming iteration of Chertia that is currently in the early planning stages. Our intention is to launch Season 6 in Q2 2023, and it will last **indefinitely**. We hope that, if this is indeed the 'ultimate' iteration of Chertia that we want it to be, **a reset will not be necessary**. The following ideas (and more) are being considered for Season 6.

Remember that these are **ideas** and are not final. We may change our mind or alter them significantly before they make it to release.

<summary>üìñ Story</summary>

Season 6 will be a soft reset of the story. Most (if not all) player characters will be reset, and the story will take place at a significantly different time from Season 5.

The story of Season 6 will revolve around the factions. Similar to Season 4, there will be no gods in the story; the story will revolve around mortal characters.

As a result, player characters will have far more importance in the story. They will be able to change the direction of events completely. For example, two factions may begin a conflict, and the story may shift to working through that conflict (or escalating it).

Players will work closely with staff members, outside of the server, to influence and change the main story.

<summary>‚öîÔ∏è Factions</summary>

Season 6 may feature a factions system. The characters will be split into several 'factions', each with a different set of ideas and goals.

The players will still come together for events, but factions will be a way for characters to distinguish themselves and their ideas.

Factions will have territories and bases.

<summary>üó£Ô∏è Characters</summary>

The biggest change to characters is that they will all originate from **in-world**. Players will use the lore to create an origin for their character. New players, who may struggle with this, will have the option to have their character originate from out-of-world. See the "integrated lore" section to learn how we plan to achieve this.

Attributes will be removed and replaced with a levelling system. Players will set their base stats, and will be able to earn 'points' that they can allocate to their character's skills, as they see fit. Points will be earned through contributions to their faction and in the main storyline.

Players will be able to select from a list of 'titles' for their character. For example, "Alexander the Brave" and "Julia the Generous". This will allow players to easily define their characters, while providing a brief but effective overview of the character for other players. Titles can be selected from a list, or gifted to a character by staff or story characters.

Instead of chat colours being tied to players, they will be tied to characters. When you create a new character, you will have a new chat colour.

<summary>üìö Integrated Lore</summary>

Between Q4 2022 and Q2 2023, we want to create a significant library of lore surrounding the world of Divian.&#x20;

To achieve this, we will work with the community to create 'articles'. These articles will revolve around people, groups, places, and events. We will use a secondary Discord server to draft, edit, and finalize these articles. At the end of the process, the articles will be uploaded to this wiki.

Communication about how to join this process will be shared soon.

<summary>üëë Staff</summary>

The structure of the staff team will change. Staff members will become "Storytellers", and will have the ability to work with players to change the storyline of the server.&#x20;

<summary>üíö Supporters</summary>

Supporters will not have more influence on the story. They will be able to select from additional titles, and will be able to select their character's colour scheme. Additional customization options may be available for supporters.
